# Why

During the downtime while transitioning to the new Double Fine forums, a bunch of community members have decided to make a small game.

# Concept
In this game, players will play as a captured hero who must encourage a villain into monologues and work on escaping while they are distracted.

# Resources
The relevant forum thread is [here](http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewthread/18058/) (note that this will probably be unavailable during most of development), and there is additional information to be found in this repo's issue tracker.

We also have an itch.io jam page to gather in any separate projects that community members create over the break which can be found [here](https://itch.io/jam/df-forum-downtime-funtime-adventure).

Cheese has put together a useful [Jam Survival Guide](http://cheesetalks.net/surviving-adventure-jam/) for new and experienced participants.

# Communication
Coordination and decision making will generally happen via IRC in the #DFAF ([webchat](http://mibbit.com/?channel=#DFAF&server=irc.foonetic.net)) and/or #DFAdventure ([webchat](http://mibbit.com/?channel=#DFAdventure&server=irc.foonetic.net)) IRC channels on foonetic.net.

# Contributing
This repository is specifically for the game's code and game-ready assets, which should be contributed as "pull requests". Asset sources should be contributed to [this repository](https://github.com/Double-Fine-Game-Club/forum-downtime-funtime-adventure-assets) instead.

We have an open contribution policy for this project, allowing anybody to contribute anything they feel comfortable contributing. We'll try to include all contributions and allow for switching between any conflicting assets.
